        <br>
            Enter your Life Changing Event and then click that Awesome Button!
        <br>
            Your To-Do List will grow and so will your responsibilities.
        <br>
            As your List grows you can click your completed task and it will be crossed out with a checkmark and a blue background.
        <br>
            If you were too ambitious and added too many tasks, just click the x button to the right of your task to obliterate that mistake.
        <br>
            When you completed all your tasks or just want to start fresh, hit that Unclutter Items button to start some more Life Changing Events!
